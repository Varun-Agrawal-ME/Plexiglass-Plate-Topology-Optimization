# Plexiglass-Plate-Topology-Optimization
In this project, the mass of the plate was optimized to withstand the load of 10 lbs and 25 lbs, which was tied to the string 
at the bottom hole and dropped from the height of 40 cm, one-by-one.
The prediction report contains the selection of the final design of the optimized plate before in-class testing. Initial Design Analysis
report explain how I reached to the final design, mesh convergence, and the comparison of maximum strain energy from the analytical solution and the FEA.
Final report include the analysis of every team member, their comparison, and the calculations on plate after the in-class testing.
