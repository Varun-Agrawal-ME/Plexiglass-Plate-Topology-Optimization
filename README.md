# Plexiglass-Plate-Topology-Optimization
In this project, the mass of the plate was optimized to withstand the load of 10 lbs and 25 lbs, which was tied to the string at the bottom hole and dropped from the height of 40 cm, one-by-one.
The prediction report contains the selection of the final design of the optimized plate (designed in CREO and simulated in ANSYS) before in-class testing. Initial Design Analysis report explain how I reached to the final design (lowered mass by 70%), mesh convergence, and the comparison of maximum strain energy from the analytical solution and the FEA (difference of 6.45 %).
Final report include the analysis of every team member, their comparison, and the calculations on plate after the in-class testing.
